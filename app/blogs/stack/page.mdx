# How I Get Things Done: My Daily Tools and Tech

<p className="text-gray-600 text-sm">Mar 1, 2025 | New Delhi, India</p>

<br />

Ever wondered what keeps a developer like me ticking? These are the tools and tech that make my days smoother—like butter on warm naan. Let’s walk through them together, one at a time.

## 1. NextJS / React - My Web Dev BFFs

React’s been my ride-or-die for about five years now. I still remember my first shaky lines of code with it—feels like forever ago. It’s everywhere these days; the web practically runs on it.

Then, two years back, I stumbled into NextJS, and oh man, it was a game-changer. It’s got all my favorites baked in—TypeScript, routing, TailwindCSS—no extra setup required. Is it flawless? Nope, there are other shiny options out there, but it just clicks for me. And those built-in API routes? Total lifesaver when I need a quick backend without wrestling with a monorepo. It’s honestly pretty darn awesome.

## 2. TailwindCSS - From Hate to Love

True story: I used to hate TailwindCSS. Setting it up felt like a slog, and those inline styles made my code look like a chaotic mess—like something a newbie AI would spit out. But then, it grew on me. Now? I can’t picture coding a frontend without it. It’s like I’ve unlocked warp speed for styling. Absolute game-changer.

## 3. ShadCN - My Customizable Sidekick

Pre-styled components can feel like a straightjacket sometimes, right? That’s where ShadCN swoops in. It hands you the code, lets you tweak it however you want, and keeps it all cozy in your repo. Customizing it is like doodling on a blank page—pure fun. I’m hooked.

## 4. Hono Js - My Backend Buddy

For lightweight backend stuff, NextJS’s API routes have my back. But when things get meatier, I call on Hono. It’s like the cooler, type-safe sibling of Express (my old pal). The syntax feels so familiar—it’s like slipping into comfy slippers after a long day. Makes building backends a breeze.

## 5. Raycast - My Mac’s Best Friend

Spotlight? Pfft, Raycast stole the show for me. It’s an app launcher on steroids—loaded with features, from built-ins to killer extensions. I’m obsessed with the Spotify integration; without it, I’d be lost picking tunes. And the clipboard history? Magic. Yeah, Alfred’s out there, but Raycast won me over with its sleek UI. I’m a happy camper.

## 6. Tmux and Neovim - My Terminal Dream Team

Tmux is my coding command center. It saves my sessions so I can dive right back into the grind—no setup fuss. It’s like having a trusty co-pilot.

<br />

Then there’s Neovim—my text editor soulmate. It’s fast, light, and bendy enough to fit my every whim. Plus, it gives me that “I totally know what I’m doing” vibe. Big thanks to [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/c/theprimeagen) for showing it off—he made it look so cool, I ditched VSCode to join the club. Now, I’m all in.
