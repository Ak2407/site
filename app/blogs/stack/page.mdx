# Tools and Tech I use daily

Following are the things I feel buttery smooth in and , they just work. Let's go
through them one by one on a high level.
<br />

## 1. NextJS / React

I have been using React for the longest time now. It's been about 5 years since I first wrote my first React code. The development around it rapid and almost everything the web is built for React first.

<br />

Now 2 years back I shifted to NextJS because it includes many things out of the box which I use regularly (Typescript , Routing, TailwindCSS). Now I am not saying it is the perfect framework, there are other alternatives too which must be better than this, but it just works for me. Also when I am building simple backend I don't have to setup a monorepo and just use it's built in API routes which is fucking awesome.

<br />

## 2. TailwindCSS

As I mentioned earlier, I use TailwindCSS for styling. When I used it for the first time, I hated it , It felt awful, too much hassle to setup , inline styles made my code look like GPT 0.1 code, but it grew on me and now I can think of writing frontend code without it. I feel fast using it , It's awesome!.

## 3. ShadCN

ShadCN offers a refreshing alternative to pre-styled components. Rather than locking you into a fixed design, it provides customizable code that lives in your repository. I enjoy using it and customising to my liking.

<br />

## 4. Hono Js

For simpler backends, I use NextJS built in API routes. But for more complex backends, Hono is my go to. It has type safety , It's really easy to implement since it's syntax is very much similar to `Express` which I used to use so it felt like home while using it.

## 5. Raycast
